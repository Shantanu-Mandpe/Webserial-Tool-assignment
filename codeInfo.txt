connectionToggle -  if ble connected then goto disconnect() else go to connect()

setConnButtonState - change wording depending on connected or not 

connect - see if bluetooth api available, if available get devices with certain constraints 
	returns device - with id,name - connect to gatt server
	returns server - get all the Rx/Tx services 
	returns characteristic - with tx startNotifications 
	change state and button etc 
	catch errors 

disconnect - if no bleDevice - console smthng else disconnect the device and change state and button etc 

onDisconnected | handleNotifications - for specific events 

nusSendString(instead of readableStream use this) | sendNextChunk - send input data (string) 20bits at a time

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vid_pid - get pid : vid of the port 

selectPort - Check if webSerial API available
	   Gives Port chosen by user (requestPort) and then return usb info as an obj 
	   set window.location.search = "?vid=12&pid=13" (example)

init(par) -  get all ports into an array 
	create a const id  -  vid : pid (arguments)
	store the port whose id matches the const in this.port and clear the w.l.s of all others
	change the vendor / Product and physicallyConnected vars 
	when connect/disconnect events happen change parameters 

connect - check if the port is connected 
	open the serial port for communication with the given options 
	if the port is open create a readableStream for receiving data from the device connected to the port
	goto monitor()

monitor - while port is open nad readableStream is there do shit 
	set this.open to true and create a reader and lock the stream to it (getReader())
	use reader.read - if done : true close the reader 
	decode and store the string/value 
	push the decoded string to the msgs array 

write - 	open a writable stream 
	create a writer and write encoded data to it    

close - 	cancle the reader created and close the port	
	 

selectPort will only have functionalty of connecting bluetooth device	
connect will have the service routines (rX and tX)
monitor will we for reading data  
write is for sending data to device
